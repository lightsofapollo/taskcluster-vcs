usage: tc-vcs <command>

tc-vcs: {{version}}

This cli is designed to abstract the differences between hg/git and deal with
higher level concepts such as applying a set of changes from one repository unto
another and using various types of caches (s3 copies of entire clones) to speed
up downloads based on where your machine lives.

Global options:

  --help : show this help message
  --config <path> : Override default configuration with a yaml file (see
                    Configuration)

Commands:

  clone : Determines the VCS in use and attempts to use caches prior to
          fetching.

  checkout-revision : Checkout particular revision in repository.

  revision : Output the current revision of a repository.

Configuration (yaml file):

To provide a greater degree of flexibility there is the option of passing a
config file the default values (and docs) are in (tc-vcs
root)/default_config.yml
